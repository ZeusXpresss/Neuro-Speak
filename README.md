## 🦉 Neuro Speak Overview

Your own custom uncensored private local text-to-speech program is here! Copy and paste text from a game or book and have TTS read it aloud. Alternatively, it can scan a region on your computer and read text (ie. Renpy games). Download any TTS model from hugging face or use default ones to get started!

I am not an expert, if there is an issue, I may not be able to fix it but I will try.
